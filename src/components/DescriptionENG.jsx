      <br />I have a clear goal: dedicate myself and focus on being a great web
      developer. Since I was a child I have always been very creative, I
      discovered that my talent is drawing and that I am passionate about
      technology, I started transferring my drawings on paper to digital
      drawings, thus learning to use Photoshop and other tools, since 2013 I
      make flyers, logos, videos and all kinds of advertising designs, however,
      I never wanted to be a graphic designer, I wanted something that went
      further and fortunately now I perform in this branch of my career.
